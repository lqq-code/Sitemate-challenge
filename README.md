The client can perform the following operations: create an issue, read issues, read an issue by ID, update an issue, and delete an issue.

3. **Read an Issue by ID:**
   ```bash
   node client.js readById <issue_id>
   ```
4. **Update an Issue:**
   ```bash
   node client.js update <issue_id>
   ```
5. **Delete an Issue:**
   ```bash
   node client.js delete <issue_id>

## Testing
### Client-Side Tests
To run client-side tests using Jest, open terminal and navigate to the test client directory:
 ```bash
    cd test 
    npx jest client.test.js
   ```
### Server-Side Tests
For server-side testing, I use Supertest to perform integration tests Express.js routes:
 ```bash
    cd test 
    npx jest server.test.js
   ```
